# 5. Surface
 - ## **Color**
    - The color theme is based on a simple blue and white design. 
    - Polygons to be added for aesthetic reasons and to add depth to the quiz (Website).
    - All of the buttons have the same shape and color. They change color once hovered over.
    - the color blue was chosen as the main color to display calmness with the idea that the user would feel relaxed as they complete the quiz.
    - The colors green and red were chosen for when the user selects a correct or wrong answer.

 - ## **Font**
    - The font 'Lato' was used throughout the website and was imported from Google Fonts.
 - ## **Favicon**
    - The favicon I opted to use was the initials of the website name which consequently is also the logo. I chose the color blue to keep the design the same.

Testing

## **Solved Bugs**
- On mobile devices when the user clicked an answer the button would stay white (In hover mode) this was fixed by using media queries and the 'active' pseudo-class to solve the issue

## **Unfixed Bugs**
- If the user clicks the answer buttons very quickly. It can generate extra correct answers. When you retry after the quiz doesn't work as intended anymore.
